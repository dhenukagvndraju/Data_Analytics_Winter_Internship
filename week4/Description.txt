Project4:- World Bank Data
Exploring the realm of data visualization in Python by utilizing powerful libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The task is to create visually engaging and informative plots, graphs, and charts based on a provided dataset.

Steps to Perform:

Dataset Familiarization:
Obtain the dataset provided for this task and examine the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and potential insights it may offer.

Library Setup:
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Set up your Python environment or Jupyter Notebook for data visualization.

Selecting Visualization Goals:
Define the goals of your data visualization. What insights or patterns do you aim to convey to the audience?

Consider the types of plots and charts that would best represent the information in your dataset.

Matplotlib Basics:
Start with Matplotlib to create fundamental visualizations like line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots.

Experiment with customization options, such as color schemes, labels, and titles.

Seaborn Styling:
Explore Seaborn to enhance the aesthetics of your visualizations.

Utilize Seabornâ€™s functionalities for statistical data visualization to uncover deeper insights.

Interactive Plots with Plotly:
Dive into Plotly to create interactive plots and dashboards.

Experiment with features like hover effects, zooming, and panning to enhance user engagement.

Combining Visualisations:
Integrate multiple visualizations into a cohesive narrative. For example, combining a line plot with a bar chart to tell a more comprehensive story.

Documentation and Interpretation:
Document your code and the rationale behind each visualization choice.

Interpret the patterns and insights derived from your visualizations. What story does the data tell?

Pre-requisites
Basic knowledge of Python programming.
Familiarity with Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
Installation of matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly libraries.
