Project 5:- SQL Detective Challenge:
Objective:

Step into the shoes of a detective and solve a murder mystery using SQL.
Additionally, embark on a web scraping adventure to collect your dataset, setting the stage for subsequent tasks in data analysis.

SQL Detective Challenge:

Introduction to the Case:
Familiarise yourself with the murder mystery case provided. Understand the structure of the crime data, including tables and relationships.

Database Setup:
Set up an SQL database, either locally or using an online platform like SQLite or MySQL.

Create tables that align with the information provided in the murder mystery case.

SQL Queries:
Develop SQL queries to extract relevant information from the database.

Use SELECT statements, JOIN operations, and WHERE clauses to uncover clues and solve the murder mystery.

Analysis and Conclusion:
Analyze the results of your SQL queries to piece together the sequence of events and identify potential suspects.

Conclude the detective challenge by summarising your findings and presenting a compelling case.

Web Scraping Adventure:

Choose a Target Website:
Select a website from which you want to collect data. Ensure it aligns with your interests or industry preferences.



Understand the Structure:
Analyze the structure of the chosen website, identifying key elements and the location of the data you want to scrape.

Web Scraping Implementation:
Utilize Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests to perform web scraping.

Extract relevant data from the website and store it in a suitable format for analysis.

Dataset Documentation:
Document the process of web scraping, including the source website, data extraction methods, and any challenges faced during the process.

Clearly outline the ethical considerations and respect the terms of use for the chosen website.

Pre-requisites
Basic understanding of SQL and relational databases.
Proficiency in using a SQL database management system (DBMS) such as SQLite or MySQL.
Familiarity with Python programming for web scraping (libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests).
